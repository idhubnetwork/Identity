## Simple Summary

A standard interface for organising an owners tokens into a set of tranches.

## Abstract

Describes an interface to support an owners tokens being grouped into tranches, with each tranche being represented by an identifying key and a balance.

Tokens are operated upon at a tranche granularity, but data about the overall supply of tokens and overall balances of owners is also tracked.

This standard is an extension of ERC777 and therefore is implicitly compatible with ERC20 and ERC777.

## Motivation

Being able to associate metadata with individual fungible tokens is useful when building functionality associated with those tokens.

For example, knowing when an individual token was minted allows vesting or lockup logic to be implemented for a portion of a token holders balance.

Tokens that represent securities often require metadata to be attached to individual tokens, such as the category of share or restrictions associated with the share.

Being able to associate arbitrary metadata with groups of tokens held by users is useful in a variety of use-cases. It can be used for token provenance (i.e. recording the previous owner(s) of tokens) or to attach data to a token which is then used to determine any transfer restrictions of that token.

In general it may be that whilst tokens are fungible under some circumstances, they are not under others (for example in-game credits and deposited balances). Being able to define such groupings and operate on them whilst maintaining data about the overall distribution of a token irrespective of this is useful in modelling these types of assets.

## Rationale

A Partially-Fungible Token allows for attaching metadata to a partial balance of a token holder. These partial balances are called tranches and are indexed by a `bytes32 _tranche` key which can be associated with metadata on-chain or off-chain.

The specification for this metadata, beyond the existence of the `_tranche` key to identify it, does not form part of this standard. The token holders address can be paired with the tranche to use as a metadata key if data varies across token holders with the same tranche (e.g. a "restricted" tranche may be associated with different lock up dates for each token holder).

For an individual owner, each token in a tranche therefore shares common metadata.

Token fungibility includes metadata so we have:
  - for a specific user, tokens within a given tranche are fungible
  - for a specific user, tokens from different tranches may not be fungible

Note - tranches with the same `bytes32` key across different users may be associated with different metadata depending on the implementation.

## Specification

### Token Information

#### balanceOfByTranche

As well as querying total balances across all tranches through `balanceOf` there may be a need to determine the balance of a specific tranche.

``` solidity
function balanceOfByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _tokenHolder) external view returns (uint256);
```

#### tranchesOf

A token holder may have their balance split into several partitions (tranches) - this function will return all of the tranches associated with a particular token holder address.

``` solidity
function tranchesOf(address _tokenHolder) external view returns (bytes32[]);
```

### Tokens Transfers

Token transfers always have an associated source and destination tranche, as well as the usual amounts and sender / receiver addresses.

#### sendByTranche

By extending the ERC777 standard, and providing a default tranche (through `getDefaultTranches`) it is possible to send tokens (from default tranches). To send tokens from a specific tranche, the `sendByTranche` function can be used.

As an example, a permissioned token may use tranche metadata to enforce transfer restrictions based on:
  - the `_tranche` value
  - any additional data associated with the `_tranche` value (e.g. a lockup timestamp that may be associated with `_tranche`)
  - any details associated with the sender or receiver of tokens (e.g. has their identity been established)
  - the amount of tokens being transferred (e.g. does it respect any daily or other period-based volume restrictions)
  - the `_data` parameter allows the caller to supply any additional authorisation or details associated with the transfer (e.g. signed data from an authorised entity who is permissioned to authorise the transfer)

Other use-cases include tracking provenance of tokens by associating previous holders with destination tranches.

This function MUST throw if the transfer of tokens is not successful for any reason.

When transferring tokens from a particular tranche, it is useful to know on-chain (i.e. not just via an event being fired) the destination tranche of those tokens. The destination tranche will be determined by the implementation of this function and will vary depending on use-case.

The function MUST return the `bytes32 _tranche` of the receiver.

The `bytes32 _tranche` of the receiver can be defined in the `bytes _data` if not generated on-chain.

This function MUST emit a `SentByTranche` event for successful transfers.

This function MUST emit a `ChangedTranche` event if the tranche of the receiver differs to the sender.

``` solidity
function sendByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _data) external returns (bytes32);
function sendByTranches(bytes32[] _tranches, address[] _tos, uint256[] _amounts, bytes _data) external returns (bytes32);
```

#### operatorSendByTranche

Allows an operator to send security tokens on behalf of a token holder.

This function MUST revert if called by an address lacking the appropriate approval as defined by `isOperatorForTranche`.

This function MUST emit a `SentByTranche` event for successful token sends.

This function MUST emit a `ChangedTranche` event if the tranche of the receiver differs to the sender.

``` solidity
function operatorSendByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes _data, bytes _operatorData) external returns (bytes32);
function operatorSendByTranches(bytes32[] _tranches, address _from, address _to, uint256[] _amounts, bytes _data, bytes _operatorData) external returns (bytes32[]);
```

### Default Management

#### getDefaultTranches

In order to provide compatibility with ERC777 / ERC20 the implementation needs to determine which tranches to use when a ERC777 `send` function is executed.

This function returns the tranches to use in this circumstance. For example, a security token may return the `bytes32("unrestricted")` tranche, or a simple implementation with a small set of possible tranches could just return all tranches associated with a token holder.

The return value can be empty which implies there is no default tranche (and hence the ERC777 `send` function will throw), or return more than one tranche, in which case the ERC777 `send` function should loop over these tranches in order until the specified amount has been successfully transferred.

``` solidity
function getDefaultTranches(address _tokenHolder) external view returns (bytes32[]);
```

#### setDefaultTranches

Allows default tranches to be set for a specified address, which will be used during ERC777 `send` function executions.

``` solidity
function setDefaultTranche(bytes32[] _tranches) external;
```

### Operators

Operators can be authorised for:
  - all token holders and tranches (`defaultOperators` inherited from ERC777)
  - all token holders for a specific tranche (`defaultOperatorsByTranche`)
  - all tranches (current and future) for a specific token holder (`isOperatorFor` inherited from ERC777)
  - a specific tranche for a specific token holder (`isOperatorForTranche`)

#### defaultOperatorsByTranche

This function returns the set of default operators who are authorised for all token holders and a specified tranche.

``` solidity
function defaultOperatorsByTranche(bytes32 _tranche) external view returns (address[]);
```

#### authorizeOperatorByTranche

Allows a token holder to set an operator for their tokens on a specific tranche.

This function MUST emit the event `AuthorizedOperatorByTranche` every time it is called.

``` solidity
function authorizeOperatorByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _operator) external;
```

#### revokeOperatorByTranche

Allows a token holder to revoke an operator for their tokens on a specific tranche.

NB - it is possible the operator will retain authorisation over this token holder and tranche through either `defaultOperatorsByTranche` or `defaultOperators`.

This function MUST emit the event `RevokedOperatorByTranche` every time it is called.

``` solidity
function revokeOperatorByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _operator) external;
```

#### isOperatorForTranche

Returns whether a specified address is an operator for the given token holder and tranche.

This should return TRUE if the address is an operator under any of the above categories.

``` solidity
function isOperatorForTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _operator, address _tokenHolder) external view returns (bool);
```

``` solidity
/// @title ERC-1410 Partially Fungible Token Standard

interface IERC1410 is IERC777 {

    // Token Information
    function balanceOfByTranche(bytes32 _tranche, address _tokenHolder) external view returns (uint256);
    function tranchesOf(address _tokenHolder) external view returns (bytes32[]);

    event SentByTranche(
        bytes32 indexed fromTranche,
        address operator,
        address indexed from,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );

    event ChangedTranche(
        bytes32 indexed fromTranche,
        bytes32 indexed toTranche,
        uint256 amount,
    );

    // Operator Events
    event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);

    event AuthorizedOperatorByTranche(bytes32 indexed tranche, address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
    event RevokedOperatorByTranche(bytes32 indexed tranche, address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);

}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

In order to remain backwards compatible with ERC20 / ERC777 (and other fungible token standards) it is necessary to define what tranche or tranches are used when a `transfer` / `send` operation is executed (i.e. when not explicitly specifying the tranche).

The following optional extension and rules can be used:
```
function getDefaultTranches(address _tokenHolder) external view returns (bytes32[]);
function setDefaultTranche(bytes32[] _tranches) external;
```

If the implementation guarantees a small number of possible tranches per token holder, it could be reasonable to iterate over all of a token holders tranches (i.e. defining `defaultTranches` using `tranchesOf`).

The token creator MUST specify a default tranche(s) which is used by the ERC20 / ERC777 functions for all token holders. Each token holder or operator of a token holder's full token balance for all tranches MAY change the default tranche of the token holder. The ability for a token holder to change their default tranche allows them to change the tranche used in ERC20 / ERC777 transfers which do not specify explicit tranches.

Here is a description of the implication for ERC777 functions:
- `send()` MUST obtain default tranche using `getDefaultTranche()`
- `operatorSend()` MUST obtain default tranche using `getDefaultTranche()`
- `burn()` MUST obtain default tranche using `getDefaultTranche()`
- `operatorBurn()` MUST obtain default tranche using `getDefaultTranche()`
- `balanceOf()` MUST count the sum of all tranche balances assigned to a token holder
- `totalSupply()` MUST count all tokens tracked by this contract
- `defaultOperators()` MUST query a list of operators which can operate over all addresses and tranches
- `authorizeOperator()` MUST authorise an operator for all tranches of `msg.sender`
- `revokeOperator()` MUST revoke authorisation of an operator previously given for all tranches of `msg.sender`
- `isOperatorFor()` MUST query whether `_operator` is an operator for all tranches of `_tokenHolder`
- `event Minted()` and `event MintedByTranche()` MUST be emited for any increases in token supply
- `event Burned()` and `event BurnedByTranche()` MUST be emited for any decreases in token supply
- `event AuthorizedOperator()` MUST be emited by `authorizeOperator()`
- `event RevokedOperator()` MUST be emited by `revokeOperator()`
